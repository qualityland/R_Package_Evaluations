\title{Undo the effect of checkpoint by resetting .libPath to user library location.}
\usage{
unCheckpoint(new)
}
\arguments{
\item{new}{Not used; for back-compatibility only.}
}
\description{
This is an experimental solution to the situation where a user no longer wants to work in the checkpointed environment. The function resets \link{.libPaths} to its pre-checkpoint value.

Note that this does not undo any of the other side-effects of \code{\link[=checkpoint]{checkpoint()}}. Specifically, all loaded packages remain loaded, and the value of \code{getOption("repos")} remains unchanged.
