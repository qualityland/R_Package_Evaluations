\usage{
hydrate(packages = NULL, ..., library = NULL, sources = NULL, project = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{The set of \R packages to install. When \code{NULL}, the
set of packages as reported by \code{\link[=dependencies]{dependencies()}} is used.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, reserved for future expansion. If any arguments
are matched to \code{...}, \code{renv} will signal an error.}

\item{library}{The \R library to be hydrated. When \code{NULL}, the active
library as reported by \code{.libPaths()} is used.}

\item{sources}{A set of library paths from which \code{renv} should attempt to
draw packages. See \strong{Sources} for more details.}

\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}
}
\value{
A named \R list, giving the packages that were used for hydration
as well as the set of packages which were not found.
}
\description{
Discover the \R packages used within a project, and then install those
packages into the active library. This effectively allows you to clone the
state of your default \R libraries for use within a project library.
}
\section{Sources}{


\code{hydrate()} attempts to re-use packages already installed on your system,
to avoid unnecessary attempts to download and install packages from remote
sources. When \code{NULL} (the default), \code{hydrate()} will attempt to discover \R
packages from the following sources (in order):
\itemize{
\item The user library,
\item The site library,
\item The system library,
\item The \code{renv} cache.
}

If package is discovered in one of these locations, \code{renv} will attempt to
copy or link that package into the requested library as appropriate.
}

\section{Missing Packages}{


If \code{renv} discovers that your project depends on \R packages not currently
installed in your user library, then it will attempt to install those
packages from the active R repositories.

\dontrun{

# hydrate the active library
renv::hydrate()
